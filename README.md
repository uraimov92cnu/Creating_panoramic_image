What is a panoramic photography?
Behind this question are hidden multiple realities. Indeed, panoramic photography is very diverse. If everyone agrees to say that it's a photo in a wide format, for some people it's also a wide field of view, for others a virtual tour, and of course your own definition...

Image Stitching with OpenCV and Python
In the first part of today’s tutorial, we’ll briefly review OpenCV’s image stitching algorithm that is baked into the OpenCV library itself via cv2.createStitcher and cv2.Stitcher_create functions.

From there we’ll review our project structure and implement a Python script that can be used for image stitching.

We’ll review the results of this first script, note its limitations, and then implement a second Python script that can be used for more aesthetically pleasing image stitching results.

Finally, we’ll review the results of our second script and again note any limitations or drawbacks.
